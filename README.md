# Coffee Machine Simulator
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it.

In this project, I programmed a coffee machine simulator using Java. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

Practiced working with methods, challenged myself with loops and conditions, and get more confident with OOP.<br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/33?track=8">https://hyperskill.org/projects/33?track=8</a>
